### Project Title
Optimizing BikeShare Proect with Git Version Control


### Prerequisites
Before you can work with or contribute to this project, make sure you have git installed on your local machine to clone the project repository, create branches, commit changes and collaborate with others. You can download git from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads/).

### Description
The project involves the practical application of version control and Git through the refactoring of a previous BikeShare project. It encompasses several key tasks:

**Repository Setup**: The project begins with forking a template repository and cloning it locally. The primary objective is to incorporate the "bikeshare.py" file, a data file, and a ".gitignore" file to prevent the data file from being tracked by version control.

**Documentation Enhancement**: A separate branch is created for documentation improvements. In this branch, project documentation is added to a README file, and docstrings within "bikeshare.py" are refined.

**Code Refactoring**: Another branch is dedicated to code refactoring. The aim here is to enhance the efficiency and readability of the "bikeshare.py" file. Multiple commits are made, each with meaningful messages.

**Branch Merging**: Finally, once the work on both branches is complete, they are merged into the master branch. The changes are then pushed to the remote repository on GitHub.

In essence, this project is about implementing Git-based version control practices in a real-world scenario to enhance an existing BikeShare project. It covers tasks related to repository setup, documentation improvement, and code refactoring, ultimately optimizing the project's codebase and documentation.
